WPF Frontend Starter

Clone this repository to `/wp-content/themes/themename/frontend/` directory.

Use `npm run dev` or `npm run prod` to build assets.

Assets will be placed in the `/wp-content/themes/themename/assets/` directory.

Use ES6 syntax for JS and SCSS for styles.

As default this starter is using `vue.esm-browser` building.
Switch `vue` alias in `webpack.config.js` if you need to use another build.
